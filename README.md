Click and drag to throw your ragdoll!
  First project for CS50X, based on the old web game Interactive Buddy. It's basically just the physics, no weapons, skins, unlockable, etc. from the original or it's sequel.
  Simply click, hold down the left mouse button, drag the torso of the body, and use the momentum of the mouse to throw by releasing the left mouse button while your mouse is in motion.
  Game is made and played with MIT Scratch.
